ABSTRACT

It should be improved, starting from some big picture under
meta-programming.

Meta programming is bla bla bla
This paper demonstrates the reflective operators from meta-programming
are useful for ... to eliminate not only the bound names coming from
... but also ... in the asynchronous pi-calculus. We extend ...
The nameless combinators are useful for .... 

I also conclude what is the application as I still do
not understand why rho-CC-calculus are useful. 


INTRODUCTION

Delete the first sentence
Start from the second sentence but delete "more generally"

Second para

citation after the pi-calculus
citation after the FM set (what is FM set? it appeared later! please
make coherence)

Page 2

However, this raises a new question ==> what is a new question? I do
not find in the following paragraph

The CC combinator calculus ==> the CC-calculus (here CC means concurrent combinators)

1.0.1 (the section numbering is strange. Can you use *)? 

please delete footnote 1

I do not think the sentence from Symbolically, will help at all since
it is not fully explained. Can you please try to explain in English
from more high-level viewpoint?
Similarly, the paragraph starts from This is exactly -- I found very
difficult to understand.

My suggestion is to delete from Symbolically until the end of the next
section and rewrite this
paragraph like:

This fixed point consgtruction is used to implement the rho calculus
in OCaml, Haskell and Scala, and is essential for the typed version of
the rho calculus to provide the soundness of code by the
construction.

(The above sentence is my guess since I do not understand around this paragraph)

OCaml, Haskell and Scala (the font is wrong) 

Please do not use wasn't. was not

Not Yoshida -- Honda and Yoshida's 


1.0.2

Please fix the numbering

an appendix 5 ==> an appendix

Related work should be in the conclusion (please look at the previous
scan)

[8] [9] The key difference ... the place of the citation is wrong
